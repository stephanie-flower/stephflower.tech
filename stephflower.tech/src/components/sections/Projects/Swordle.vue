        Swordle was a multiplayer word-guessing game, where you compete to guess the word first. Based on Wordle, this game was completed in a weekend by our team at the hackathon Royal Hackaway v5.
        It may be offline now due to hosting costs, but it is available to view on Devpost <a href="https://devpost.com/software/swordle" target="_">here!⧉</a>. <br />
        Swordle was built using pure Javascript, HTML and CSS, with websocket netcode in Django. <br />
        It won 2nd place! <br>
